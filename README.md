Fine-Tuning:- Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pretrained machine learning model and further training it on a smaller, targeted data set. The aim of fine-tuning is to
maintain the original capabilities of a pretrained model while adapting it to suit more specialized use cases.

Fine-tuning uses the weights of a pre-trained model as a starting point for further training on a smaller dataset of examples that more directly reflect the specific tasks and 
use cases the model will be utilized for. It typically entails supervised learning, but can also involve reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning or semi-supervised learning.

Pros/Cons of Fine Tuning:- There are so many advantages or disadvantages of Fine-Tuning model which is explained below.


Pros:-

1.Refine/Enhance Performance:-Fine-tuning allows you to take a pre-trained model that already has learned features from a large dataset and adapt it to your specific task or dataset. This often leads to better performance compared to training a model from scratch, especially when the pre-trained model was trained on a large and diverse dataset.

2.Reduced Data Requirements:- Fine-tuning requires less data than training a model from scratch because the model starts with features that have already been learned from a larger dataset. This is particularly useful in scenarios where collecting a large dataset is difficult or expensive.

3.Utilization of Pre-trained Knowledge:- Fine-tuning allows leveraging knowledge learned from large, pre-existing datasets, such as ImageNet for image tasks or large text corpora for natural language processing. This pre-trained knowledge includes features, patterns, and representations that can generalize well to new tasks or datasets.


Cons:-

1.Overfitting:- Fine-tuning a model on a small dataset can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specific to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

2.Dependency on Pre-trained Model Quality:- The success of fine-tuning heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the pre-trained model. If the pre-trained model is not well-suited to the target task, fine-tuning may not provide significant benefits.

3.Forgetting Previous Learning:- Sometimes, fine-tuning can make the model forget what it learned before, especially if the new task is very different from what it was originally trained on.
